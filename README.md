# Conveyor Processing


## :pencil2: Overview

**Conveyor Processing** is my defense project for **Introduction to Programming** at **Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics**. It is a console application that can perform simple operations on numbers according to the wishes of the user.

## :computer: Functionality
 - At the start of the program,random numbers and functions are generated
 - Then, the user can choose one of the following commands by selecting a corresponding letter

**See all numbers** - prints the generated numbers from a file,where they are saved

**Change one number** - gives the user the ability to change a number from the list with one of their wish (validation of the format of numbers and whether it is present in the list of already generated numbers)

**See all functions** - prints the generated functions from a file,where they are saved

**Change one function** - gives the user the ability to change a function from the list with one of their wish (validation of the format of functions and whether it is present in the list of already generated functions)

**Do matrix calculation** - performs each function on every number and forms a matrix with the results. On selection of this command, the user has the following opportunities

	 - *Activate carry mode*: carry mode is such mode where the function is performed on the sum of the current number and the result from the previous operation, rather than only on the number itself
	 
	 - Choose *output format*- either plain text or JSON
	 
	 - Choose whether to *save the output as a file*, too, or not

**Exit** - causes the program to end; a goodbye message is printed
